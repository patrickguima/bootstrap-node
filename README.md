# bootstrap-node
A fake page aplication with bootstrap and node. Just to learn the basics and have fun!!!

### HOW TO ###

You need to install nodejs

Inside the repository

    npm install express

    npm start

that's it!!!!


If you wanna make changes and don't want to run "npm start" every time, you can use NODEMON (he looks for changes e reaload the page), just need to install and run "npm run watch ".
The package.json already contains the script for nodemon.
