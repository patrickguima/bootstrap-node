single page aplication with bootstrap and node

###how to###

you need to install nodejs

inside the repository

    npm install express

    npm start

that's it!!!!


if you wanna make changes and don't want to have to run "npm start" every time, you can use NODEMON, just need to install and run "npm run watch ".
The package.json already contems the script for nodemon.!!!!
