# bootstrap-node
single page aplication with bootstrap and node

#how to
install nodejs\n
inside the repository\n
run "npm install express"\n 
run "npm start"\n
that's it!!!!\n


if you wanna make changes and don't want to have to run "npm start" every time, you can use NODEMON, just need to install and run "npm run watch ".
The package.json already contems the script for nodemon.!!!!
